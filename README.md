# Hospital-Mortality-Analysis

## 📖 Project Description
This academic project analyzes the relationship between hospital resources—such as doctors, nurses, beds, and other facilities—and patient mortality rates using the Apriori algorithm. The main goal is to uncover patterns and insights that can help hospitals reduce death rates through better resource allocation.
